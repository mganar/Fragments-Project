renpy-8.3.7-sdk/

üõ† Troubleshooting Tips


- Game Not Showing Up?
  - Make sure your project folder is placed directly inside the Ren'Py SDK directory (next to `renpy.exe`).  
  - Confirm the project contains a `game/` subfolder with at least one `.rpy` file (e.g., `script.rpy`).


- Example of Correct Structure:
C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\renpy-8.3.7-sdk\MyGameProject\game\script.rpy
