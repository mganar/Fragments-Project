    "The cave feels colder now."

    "The lights flicker weakly — shadows twitching across the rock walls like something alive."

    "Suki still floats — limp and wrong. Breathing something that doesn’t sound like breathing anymore."

    "Nobody moves."

    "Tomo kneels under her, hands trembling, tears streaking the dust on his face."

    "Commander Iven paces by the broken heater, muttering sharp, ugly things under his breath."

    "Niko sits cuffed at the base of the heater — head bowed, shaking."

    "We carry her."

    "The caves stretch out forever. Narrow. Twisting."

    "The air tastes metallic."

    "Or what’s left."

    "Bodies broken into angles that don't make sense — thrown across the rock like dolls."

    "And some of them — some are still moving."

    "Twitching. Crawling."

    "Their eyes — pure black."
