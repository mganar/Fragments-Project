    "The portable heaters buzz weakly against the damp chill."

    "Suki floats — still faintly hovering above the stretcher. Breathing shallow. Whatever latched onto her isn’t letting go."

    "Tomo sits hunched beside her, jacket bunched in his fists — wiping the blood from her lip with hands that won’t stop shaking."

    "Commander Iven stands over Niko — who’s cuffed and slumped against the cavern wall, face bruised from earlier."

    "Renn’s already gone. Swallowed up by the tunnels. And with him — the ration key."

    "Veyla lingers at the edge of the light — watching without a word."

    "I crouch by the heater, staring at the emergency beacon. Still blinking. Still useless."

    "Tomo stops talking. Just watches Suki breathe. Counting each shallow rise and fall."

    "Niko flinches at every noise — muttering under his breath, rocking slightly."

    "Cael burns through the last power cells — keeping the heaters running just a little longer."

    "I wrap my arms around myself, pretending I don't hear my stomach clawing inside my chest."

    "Veyla keeps her distance. Calculating. Cold."

    "Commander Iven gets harsher."

    "Discipline curdles into cruelty."

    "Slip up once — you're shoved into the dirt. Slip up twice — you're bleeding."

    "Tomo screams her name — lost in the roaring thunder of crumbling rock."

    "Veyla doesn't move. Just watches. Still."

    "Commander Iven curses — grabbing Niko, dragging him like a shield."

    "Cael bolts for the nearest tunnel — yelling something I can’t hear over the noise."

    "The floor splits open."

    "Air sucked out of the chamber."

    "Lights spinning wild."

    "For one heart-stopping second — I see it all:"

    "Suki — still floating — mouth open in a silent, endless scream—"

    "Renn’s shadow — disappearing down a collapsing corridor—"

    "The beacon — blinking one last desperate time before the dark swallows it whole."
